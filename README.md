# Code Quiz

## Description

A timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions that deducts from the score when answered incorrectly. This project further familiarized me with working on JavaScript and how it can interact with html and css files. Bootstrap classes were also used in the index.html file to provide prebuilt styling to the webpage.
